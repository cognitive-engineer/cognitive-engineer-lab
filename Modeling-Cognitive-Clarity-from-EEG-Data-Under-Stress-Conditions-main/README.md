# Modeling-Cognitive-Clarity-from-EEG-Data-Under-Stress-Conditions

**Modeling Cognitive Clarity Using EEG Data from Stress Tasks**

This project uses real EEG data (dataset attached below) to simulate how stress affects cognitive clarity in humans. By analyzing beta/alpha band activity across different tasks (Relaxation, Arithmetic, Stroop, Mirror Image), we quantify and visualize a clarity score that reflects real-time cognitive performance under pressure.

## What We Did
- Loaded EEG recordings from 40 subjects doing stress-inducing tasks
- Calculated per-row alpha and beta band power from 32 EEG channels
- Modeled a **Clarity Score** = inverse of beta/alpha ratio × stress label
- Visualized how cognitive clarity drops during mentally demanding tasks

## Why It Matters
Stress doesn't just “feel bad”—it changes your brain's electrical signals in measurable ways. This model gives a quantifiable window into how your mental clarity tanks under load—and sets the stage for simulating recovery, intervention, and optimization.

## Next Steps
- Simulate cognitive enhancers (Bacopa, breathwork, etc.)
- Build a personalized stress → clarity timeline
- Create interactive notebooks for intervention testing
