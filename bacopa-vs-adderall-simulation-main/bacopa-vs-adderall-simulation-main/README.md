# Bacopa vs Adderall â€“ Cognitive Performance Simulation

This project simulates how memory performance changes over one year under three cognitive enhancement strategies:

- ðŸ’Š **Adderall** (taken 1x, 2x, or 5x per week)
- ðŸŒ¿ **Bacopa Monnieri** (taken daily)
- âšª **No intervention** (baseline mental fluctuation)

The simulation helps visualize how short-term spikes (Adderall) compare to long-term gains (Bacopa) using AI-style cognitive modeling.

## ðŸ§  What's Being Modeled

- **Memory Score (0â€“100):** A synthetic metric representing working memory, attention span, and learning capacity
- **Time:** Simulated daily for 365 days (1 year)
- **Noise:** Gaussian randomness added to reflect day-to-day mental variability

## ðŸ”¬ Methodology

We used Python to simulate three conditions:

| Agent           | Simulation Logic                                  |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Bacopa (daily) | Linear rise in memory score â†’ plateau after 90 days |
| Adderall       | Spikes on dose days only â†’ decays with tolerance |
| Baseline       | No intervention â†’ fluctuates with noise only     |

All memory curves are built using rule-based logic (symbolic AI), not machine learning.

## ðŸ“Š Output

- Three visual comparisons (IG-ready square format):
  - Adderall 5x/week vs Bacopa
  - Adderall 2x/week vs Bacopa
  - Adderall 1x/week vs Bacopa
- Clean plots with baseline, consistent formatting, and high-legibility for social or scientific content

## ðŸ¤– Why Itâ€™s AI-Based

This project applies **symbolic AI techniques** â€” using hand-coded rules to simulate cognitive state changes over time. This is commonly used in cognitive architectures like ACT-R and SOAR. While it doesn't use neural networks, it reflects the same AI foundations that power decision-making models in neuroscience.
